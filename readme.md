# AVL Tree

AVL tree adapted from Julienne Walker's presentation at
http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_avl.aspx.

I found the presentation at the above site easy to follow.  Walker gives
several variations, I just coded one here as a relatively simple example
of working AVL code.  It's serviceable as is.  It might also make a good
starting point for a more polished package.

I originally coded this for a
[Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) task.
I'm releasing it here as public domain.
